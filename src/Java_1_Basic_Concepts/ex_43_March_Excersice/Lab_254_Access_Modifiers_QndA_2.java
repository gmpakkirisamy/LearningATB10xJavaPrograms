        //1) Why is the private access modifier used in encapsulation?
        // The private access modifier is used in encapsulation to restrict direct access to certain class members
        // (variables and methods) from outside the class. This is essential for data hiding and controlled access,
        // ensuring that an object's internal state is protected from unintended modifications.

        //2) Write a program to demonstrate the use of public, private, protected, and default access modifiers.
        //Please refer lab program number.
