        //1) What are the four types of access modifiers in Java? and what are their scopes?

        //ACCESS_MODIFIERS:
        //PUBLIC-This member is accessible from any other class
        //PROTECTED - This member is accessible only in the folder and their subclasses
        //PRIVATE- This member is accessible only in the same class and not accessible by any other class.
        //DEFAULT  - If no access modifier is specified, then the member is accessible only within its
                    //own package.

        //2) Can we override a private method?
        //No we cannot override the private method because, private member is only accessed
        //inside the class

        //3) What is the difference between default and protected access modifiers?
