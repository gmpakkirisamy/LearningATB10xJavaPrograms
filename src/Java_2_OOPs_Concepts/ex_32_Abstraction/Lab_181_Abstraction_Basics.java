    //ABSTRACTIONS
    //Abstractions in java is the fundamental concept of OOP that hides the completes
    //implementation details and shows only essential features.
    //It can be achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.

    //ABSTRACT CLASS - This is the class that is INCOMPLETE in nature and it will wait to
    //complete by others. An Abstract class is the class which is not initiated and may
    //contain the abstract methods.

    // If method is abstract then class also should be abstract
    // If this abstract class is extended by the child, then child should override this method inside the abstract class.
    // If you think that parent class method should be overridden in the child class means you have to use the abstract for this case.

    // Refer - Lab_182_Vehicle_abstract - For more detailed understanding
