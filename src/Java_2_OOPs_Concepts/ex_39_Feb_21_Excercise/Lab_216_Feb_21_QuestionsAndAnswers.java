//    1) what is method overloading? Give Example, Write a Program for That.
            //Method overloading in Java is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method with the same name,
            // but with different parameter lists (different type, number, or both). It is a way to achieve polymorphism in Java.
            // Example Program: Lab_217_Method_Overlaoding.java
//
//    2) What is method overriding? Give Example, Write a Program for That.
            //Method overriding in Java is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that
            // is already defined in its superclass. The overridden method in the subclass should have the same name, return type,
            // and parameters as the method in the superclass.
//
//    3) What is the difference between Inheritance and Polymorphism?
            //INHERITANCE is nothing but in java that one class(sub class) which inherit its properties, behaviors and attributes of
            //another class (super class) is called an Inheritance
            //Types of Inheritance - 1. Single, Multilevel, Multiple, Hierarchical and Hybrid Inheritance.

            //POLYMORPHISM
            //Polymorphism is an ability of an object to take the many forms. Behaviour can change.
            //As example, as a father who can take husband role, father role, employee role etc
    // TWO TYPES
    //a. Method overloading
    //Class may have same function name with overloaded different parameter.
    //It should be in same class (function)
    //During the initialization it will choose which function has to be used
    //based on the input data. During compile time it will decide.
    //Also, another definition, Declaring the multiple method in same class with same method name but
    //different in parameter can be called as method overloading
    //Inheritance is not required.

    //b. Method overriding

    // Inheritance is required for method overriding
    // Basically child class will override the parent class method.
    // During the run time it's decided to which object to be created

//    4) What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding?

    // During the run time it's decided to which object to be created


//    5) What is the super keyword, and how is it used in Java?
    //Super keyword in java is a reference variable that allows access to the method, variables and constructor of parent class.
    //use of super with variables
    //use of super with methods
    //use of super with constructors

//    6) Can you override a static method in Java? Why or why not?
    //STATIC KEYWORD
    //Non Access modifier that is used to indicate that a particular member(variable, method)
    //Static members are shared across all the instances
    //They may be a
    //Static Variable
    //Static Method
    //Static Block
    //Static Class (not useful)
