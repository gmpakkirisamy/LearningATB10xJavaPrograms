    //INTERFACES
//Interfaces provide complete abstraction, contains only method declaration without implementations.
// We cannot create concrete or complete method in it.
// We can create concrete or complete method in it using default method only.
//Implements can be used only in case of interfaces.
// We can do multiple inheritance using the implements and Interface.

//ABSTRACT VS INTERFACE

//Keyword - abstract and interface

// Abstract can use any access modifiers (public, protected, private) but interface can have only public
