        // Concepts
//            1. Class
//            2. Objects
//            3. Constructors
//            4. Inheritance
//            5. Polymorphism
//            6. Encapsulation
//            7. Abstraction

        // Class -> It's the blueprint/template/User defined data type. This will not consume memory
            //Attributes
            //Behaviour


        // Objects -> Real entity which is created based on the blueprint/template is called as object. This will consume memory.
                        //It's the instance of class. An object can represent a person, place or any other item


        //Constructors - It is the special method which is invoked automatically at the time of object creation
                        //Once the object is created immediately. Name will be created after the object is created. Ref:Lab_131_Constructors.java
                        //This should not have any access modifier to be typed like void/private/public
                        //Constructor name should be same as the method and should not have return type - This is condition.
                        //And this will be automatically called when the object is created.

        //Instance Variable - Is a type of variable that is defined in a class and is specified to each instance of that class. They are created when an
        //object is created and destroyed when the object is destroyed.
