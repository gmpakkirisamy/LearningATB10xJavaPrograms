    //POLYMORPHISM
    //Polymorphism is an ability of an object to take the many forms. Behaviour can change.
    //As example, as a father who can take husband role, father role, employee role etc

    //Two Methods we can achieve this polymorphism

    //1. Method overloading
                //Class may have same function name with overloaded different parameter.
                //It should be in same class (function)
                //During the initialization it will choose which function has to be used
                //based on the input data. During compile time it will decide.
                //Also, another definition, Declaring the multiple method in same class with same method name but
                //different in parameter can be called as method overloading
                //Inheritance is not required.

    //2. Method overriding

                // Inheritance is required for method overriding
                // Basically child class will override the parent class method.
                // During the run time it's decided to which object to be created
}
