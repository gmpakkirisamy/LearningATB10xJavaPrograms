    // EXCEPTIONS
    // An Exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the instructions
    // If no exception is handled then control will be passed to the JVM and JVM will terminate the program.
    // Error Vs Exceptions (They are very different)
    // This to be handled wisely.
    // Error - You cannot handle. (Stack Error/Memory Error/Etc)
    //Exceptions - You can handle-try catch, try catch finally, throw, throws....

    //TWO TYPES
    //1. Checked - JVM knows it during the compile time
    // Refer : Lab_223_Exception_Unchecked
    //2. Unchecked - JVM does not know it , this will come to know at the run time.
    //Refer : Lab_224_Exception_Checked
