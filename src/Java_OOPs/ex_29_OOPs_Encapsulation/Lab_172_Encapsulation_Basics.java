        //Java that bundling data(attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into single unit,
        //typically called as a class
        //Encapsulation says that you should hide the data variables
        //Other words - Data variables -> Instance Variables -> They should not be accessed by outside without the methods.
            //Data members are private in nature
            //only Getter, Setter method are used to access the data.

    // Refer programs for more understanding

    //PUBLIC - Any one can access
    //PRIVATE - Only class can access
    //PROTECTED -Only can access with in the folder. Outside the folder cannot be accessed.
