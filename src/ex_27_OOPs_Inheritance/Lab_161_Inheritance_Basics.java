    //SINGLE INHERITANCE

    //Inheritance in hava, allows one class(the subclass) to inherit attributes and behaviour from another class.

    //Superclass | Parent class | Father class - This is the class where properties and methods are inherited

    //Subclass| Child | Son - The class that inherits from another class

    // CAB -> Class contains - Attributes + Behaviour

    // extends Keyword : Used to indicate that a class is inheriting from another class.

    // Son can extend the Father properties but vice versa is not possible which means Father cannot use the son's properties

    //MULTILEVEL INHERITANCE
